title: Installation
---

You can install the deploy tool from within the [py-deploy](https://github.com/trustlines-protocol/contracts/blob/master/py-deploy/README.md)
directory by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt -e .
```

You can otherwise install it by running

```bash
pip install trustlines-contracts-deploy
```

You can verify proper installation by running `tl-deploy --help`, which should bring up the help for the tool.
