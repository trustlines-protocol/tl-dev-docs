[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components.
It enforces us to design the UI components in a cleaner way and helps with development and discovery of components.

## Add Component
Go to `/src/shared/storybook/stories` and search either for the suited file or create a new one if it does not exist. You can then import your component and add a respective story for it. See the [official guide](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-react-native/) for more information.

## Display Storybook
To access the storybook you have to start the mobileapp in `dev` mode and navigate to `Account > Storybook`.
