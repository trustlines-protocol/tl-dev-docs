title: Getting started
---

Since the Trustlines App is build with React-Native a pre-requisite is that you have set up your machine for React-native
development. Make sure that you've followed the official React-Native Guide for building with the
[React-Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

Another pre-requisite is that you have a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project set(used for tracking analytics
and sending push notifications) and a [Notifee](https://notifee.app/) account (a library used for displaying push notifications).

:::warning React-Native CLI!
Make sure that you've set up your environment for development with the React-Native CLI. The Trustlines app is not an Expo
app and you won't be able to run it unless you configure your environment properly.
:::

## Before you Begin

Keep the following things in mind

:::warning Package name
By default the iOS Bundle ID of the App is `app.trustlines` and the Android package name is `network.trustlines.mobileapp`.
If you keep those names you won't be able to publish the app in the App Store or Android Play Store as those are taken by
us. So if you want to publish your own version of the Trustlines App you'll have to modify the Bundle ID and the Android package
name. Throughout this documentation we will use the default Bundle ID and Android package name, but you should make sure
that you use the correct Bundle ID and Android Package name for your app.
:::

:::warning Config flavors
The Trustlines App can be run in 3 modes - develop, staging, and production. We do this by providing config files for
each of those modes. Additionally, every mode sets a different Bundle ID and Android Package name. If you don't want
to set up all of those modes, just copy your default config for every mode.
:::


## Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trustlines-network/mobileapp.git
cd mobileapp
```

## Firebase Config
Head up to your Firebase project and download the `GoogleServices.plist`(iOS) and `google-services.json`(android) config
files.

Place the `GoogleServices.plist` file in `/firebase/ios/**` and the `google-services.json` file in `/firebase/android/**`.
Later when you run `yarn` those files will be copied to `/ios/firebase_environements` (at xCode build time the correct
`.plist` file will be copied to the ios bundle) and to `/android/app/src/**`

## Notifee Config
The app comes with a `notifee.config.json.dist` file. Rename this file to `notifee.config.json` and place the correct
Notifee API keys.

More information about Notifee can be found here:
https://notifee.app/

:::note
When running the app in debug mode you don't need valid Notifee keys.
:::

## Crowdin
:::note
This is optional and applies only if you want to use crowdin for your translation efforts.
:::

Rename the `crowdin.yml.dist` file to `crowdin.yml` and specify your API keys in it.

## .env Files
Rename the `.env.dist` to `.env.e2e`, `.env.develop`, `env.staging` and `env.production`.
The values in `.env.dist` would by default connect you with the trustlines staging relay server, which is connected to
the Laika chain. The staging relay server is configured to pay for your transactions made on the Laika chain, so it can
be used to quickly test the app.

:::warning
The staging relay server is configured to use our firebase config for sending push notifications. Since the app that you
build will use your own firebase project the push notification token that you generate will be incompatible with the
push notification tokens that the staging server expects, and your app won't be able to send/receive push notifications.

Because of that you are recommended to run your own relay server instance and configure the app to connect to it.
:::


## Yarn Setup
After you've spent some time setting up all pre-requisites it's time to get to the fun and install the required dependencies.

```bash
$ yarn
```

To run the app in debug mode first start the [React-Native Metro server](https://facebook.github.io/metro/) by running:

```
$ yarn run start
```

To compile the app in debug mode run

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="ios"
  values={[
    { label: 'iOS', value: 'ios', },
    { label: 'Android', value: 'android', }
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="ios">

You first need to install the cocoapods dependencies. Move to the `/ios` folder and execute `pod install`

```bash
$ cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

Now run

```bash
$ yarn run start:ios
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="android">

```bash
$ yarn run start:android
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Hot-Reloading
Hot-reloading is available and can be enabled via the dev menu

Android & iOS: shake you device, really, not a joke. Shake it and the DEV menu will appear.
While using the simulator hit `cmd + d` on iOS or `cmd + m` on Android to open the DEV menu


## Common Issues

```bash
"Unable to resolve module `stream` ...
```
run ```yarn run hack```
